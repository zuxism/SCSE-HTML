# SCSE-HTML

## Concept

Everything is organised in sections. Sections have a title and markdown content. This quick guide is one section.

## Sections

### Creating

To add sections press the top or bottom '+' buttons.

### Deleting

To delete sections first press 'Edit' on the right side of the section then press the 'ðŸ—‘' button.

### Editing

To edit sections press 'Edit' on the right side of the section.

#### Title

The title is edited as a pure single line string at the top of the edit area.

#### Content

The content is edited as markdown in a multi line textbox in the edit area below the title.

### Moving

To move sections first press 'Edit' on the right side of the section, then use the arrow buttons to move up/down.
